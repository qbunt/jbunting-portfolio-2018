Wendy Threads is an interactive T-shirt builder for the Wendy's Restaurant chain. Wendy Threads launched with a street team promotion in Times Square and hit 100,000 visits and 8,000 T-shirt submissions within 24 hours of launch.

This app features easy to use design tools and a library of 300 creative assets. The number of assets, great performance, and ease of use has prompted over 12,000 T-shirt submissions in the first week.

My responsibility for the app was the front end app architecture, the gallery, social integration and API communication. The gallery uses a blitted rendering technique to smoothly handle 800 gallery tiles with fast frame rates. This app uses an MVCS architecture facilitated by Robotlegs and Swift Suspenders.
